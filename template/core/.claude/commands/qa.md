Run QA validation against recent changes.

1. Run `git diff --name-only` to identify which areas changed.
2. Read `ai/CHECKLISTS/qa.md` for the full checklist.
3. Run the appropriate test suites for the affected areas:
   - Unit/integration: `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`
   - End-to-end (if UI/flow changed): `{{E2E_COMMAND}}`
4. Run an integrity audit: check for `.only`, skipped tests, or mocked-away security checks in changed test files (see `ai/STANDARDS/TESTING_STANDARD.md`).
5. If UAT/acceptance docs exist for the changed feature, walk through each acceptance criterion and verify it.
6. If UI changed, spot-check responsive behavior and loading/empty/error states.
7. Summarize: tests passed/failed, acceptance criteria status, any issues found.
8. For any issues found, recommend whether to file a tracked issue per `ai/STANDARDS/GITHUB_ISSUES.md`.
